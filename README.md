# NLP-Sentiment-pipeline
This project focuses on NLP-based sentiment classification, specifically applied to the IMDB movie review dataset(kaggle source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harshitshankhdhar/imdb-dataset-of-top-1000-movies-and-tv-shows), with the goal of determining whether a review expresses a positive or negative sentiment.

## Features

All features are implemented in Package_IMDB.py:
- Dataset: IMDB movie reviews (binary sentiment)
- Text preprocessing: Cleaning, stopword removal, stemming, WordNet lemmatization, word frequency analysis
- Feature extraction: TF-IDF
- Dimensionality reduction: PCA
- Classification models: Random Forest, SVM, Gaussian Naive Bayes
- Model persistence: model saving and loading using Pickle

## Project Status

This project is a work in progress.
The core package file has been uploaded.
I will upload the main pipeline script to demonstrate how to use the package.

## About the Author

I am from Taiwan and currently an undergraduate student at the University of Nottingham, majoring in Statistics. I am expected to graduate in June 2027. This project is part of my preparation for applying to PhD programs.

I built this project to demonstrate my ability to self-learn NLP techniques and construct sentiment analysis workflows.
